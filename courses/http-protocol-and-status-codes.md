# HTTP Protocol & Status Codes

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a set of rule which is used for transferring the files like, audio, video, graphic image, text and other multimedia files on the WWW (World Wide Web). HTTP is a protocol that is used to transfer the hypertext from the client end to the server end, but HTTP does not have any security. Whenever a user opens their Web Browser, that means the user indirectly uses HTTP.
